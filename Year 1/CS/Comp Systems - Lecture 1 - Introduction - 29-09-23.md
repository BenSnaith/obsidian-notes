    ## What is a computer?
    
    A computer is an electronic device, operating under a series of instructions stored within it’s own memory, that can accept data, process data and produce results.
    
    There are two main categories of computer
    
    - General Purpose - perform a wide variety of tasks
    - Special purpose - dedicated to perform a singular task
    
    There are four main types of computers
    
    - Mobile computers and mobile devices
    - Personal computers
    - Embedded computers
    - Mini-computers, mainframes and supercomputers
    
    ## Mobile Computers and Devices
    
    Mobile computer: personal computer you can carry from place to place such as a laptop, netbook or a tablet PC.
    
    Mobile Devices: computing device small enough to hold in your hand such as a smartphone, PDA, Kindle, Calculator etc.
    
    ## Personal Computers
    
    A personal computer can perform all of its input, processing, output and storage activities by itself.
    
    General purpose and for individual use.
    
    Two popular types: PC and Mac.
    
    ## Embedded Computers
    
    An embedded computer is a special-purpose computer that functions as an component in a larger product, such as a Smart Phone, Camera, Digital TV, Video Recorder, Thermostat, Airbag, Cruise Control, Printer, Copier.
    
    ## Mainframe
    
    A mainframe is a large, expensive, powerful computer that can handle hundreds or thousands of users simultaneously.
    
    ## Supercomputers
    
    A supercomputer is the fastest most powerful computer capable of processing trillions of instructions a second.
    
    ## Von Neumann Architecture
    
    Most modern designs of computer are based on his key concept (1945): stored program concept.
    
      
    
    - Data/instructions are stored in a single read/write memory
    - The contents of this memory are addressable by location
    - Execution of instructions occurs in a sequential fashion from one instruction to the next unless modified with something like a loop.
    
    ## Harvard Architecture
    
    Mark 1 Harvard Architecture: physically separate storage and signal pathways for instructions and data.
    
    A modified Harvard Architecture: relaxes the strict separation between the instruction and data while still letting the CPU concurrently access two or more memory busses
    
    ## Computer System
    
    A complete and functional hardware and software setup with everything needed to implement computing performance.
    
    Four components:
    
    - Hardware
        - Processes data by executing commands
        - Provides input and output
        - Control input, output and storage components
    - Software
        - Instructions tell hardware exactly what tasks to perform and in what order
        - Applications and system software
    - Data
        - Fundamental representation of facts and observations
    - Comms
        - Sharing data and processing among different systems
    
    ## Hardware
    
    A computer contains many electronic and mechanical components known as hardware.
    
    - CPU
    - Memory
    - Storage Devices
    - System Bus
    - Input / Output devices
    - Communication device

        Computer Hardware: Abstract View
        
    
    ## CPU: Central Processing Unit (the brain guys)
    
    - ALU (Arithmetic and Logic unit)
        - Performs arithmetic and Boolean logical calculations
    - CU (Control Unit)
        - Controls processing of instructions
        - Controls movement of data within the CPU
    - Registers
        - Provide small storage internal to the CPU to store active instructions and data
        - Physically within the CPU, very fast as close proximity to access
    - Interconnection
        - Provides for communication among the control unit, ALU and registers
    
    **Various Types**
    
    - **Instruction Set**: the complete collection of instructions understood by one CPU
        - RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) e.g ARM, MIPS
        - CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) e.g X86
    - **Performance**: core, core type, clock speed.
    
    ## Memory
    
    **Main Memory:** also known as primary storage, working storage which is directly contacted by the CPU
    
    - RAM and ROM which holds both instructions and data of a computer program
        - ROM (non-volatile): small and hold basic bootstrapping firmware
        - RAM (volatile): large enough to hold most running program
        - Main memory physically separates from the main CPU so quite slow compared to registers.
        - Need more quick storage: most processors contain cache
    
    **Long-term storage:** disk, SSD, USB flash drive, memory card, CD/DVD etc.
    
    # Data Representations
    
    The information is represented as in digital data i.e. binary format
    
    Computers systems store, present and help us modify any kind of data:  
    Numeric, text, images and graphics etc.  
    
    Different standards for different type of data representations, e.g. 2’s compliment, floating points, ASCII, Unicode, JPEG, BMP, GIF, MPEG-4, MP3, PDF, PostScript, etc.
    
    ## Why Binary?
    
    ![[Untitled 3 17.png|Untitled 3 17.png]]
    
    A computer circuit represents the 0 or the 1 electronically by the presence or absence of an electrical charge
    
    **Boolean logic**: manipulation of binary values; and, nor, not etc.
    
    **Logic gate**: electronic devices implementing Boolean operations.
    
    **Bits** are stored as charged and uncharged memory cells or as microscopic magnets on a hard disk.
    
    **Eight bits** grouped together are called a byte.
    
    ## Computer Software
    
    Software, also called a program, tells the computer what tasks to perform and how to perform them.
    
    - System software
        - Operating System
        - Utility Program
    - Application software
    
    A programmer develops software or writes the instructions that direct the computer to process data into information
    
    ![[Untitled 4 16.png|Untitled 4 16.png]]
    
    ## Java compilation process
    
    A java compiler converts the Java source code into instructions for the JVM
    
    The instructions, called bytecodes, are the same for any OS
    
    A CPU-specific JVM interprets bytecodes on a particular computer.

    ## Networks and the Internet
    
    A network is a collection of computers and devices connected together, often wirelessly, via communications devices and transmission media.
    
    - LAN, WAN, Internet, WWW, NIC, MAC, Packet Switching
    - How internet addressing works
    - Layered TCP/IP architecture of each later
    
    ## Client servers
    
    A server controls access to a hardware, software, and other resources on a network.
    
    - Provides a centralized resources for multiple clients
    
    ![[Untitled 6 13.png|Untitled 6 13.png]]
    
    ## Cloud Computing
    
    A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction
    
    ![[Untitled 7 12.png|Untitled 7 12.png]]
    
    ## Early ‘hard-wired’ computers
    
    In 1623 the first mechanical calculator was invented by William Shickard.
    
    ![[Untitled 8 12.png|Untitled 8 12.png]]
    
    Soon after this in the 1640s, Blaise Pascal came up with the machine, the Pascaline.
    
    ![[Untitled 9 11.png|Untitled 9 11.png]]
    
    Gottfried Leibnitz, a German mathematician, came up with a more advanced machine capable of multiplication and division in 1673. It was purely mechanical with now external power.
    
    ![[Untitled 10 11.png|Untitled 10 11.png]]
    
    In 1822 Charles Babbage invented the first mechanical computer, the Difference Engine.
    
    ![[Untitled 11 9.png|Untitled 11 9.png]]
    
    ## The first programmer
    
    In 1834 Ada Byron, Lady Lovelace, got fascinated by the concept of the Analytical Engine and worked out how to calculate Bernoulli numbers on it, the first computer program.
    
    ## Separation of data and program
    
    The ‘Program’ - sequence of processes to be performed - was hard wired in
    
    Data on which those processes were to be performed was input when you wanted to run the program
    
    No memory, No data storage
    
    ## The Turing Machine
    
    Concept developed in 1936 - a mathematical description of a very simple device capable of arbitrary computations, which proved properties of computation in general.
    
    ## The first electronic programmable computer
    
    Still taking up a while room, ENIAC was originally designed in 1945 to calculate the trajectories for US artillery but could do other things too!
    
    ## Moore’s Law
    
    [](https://www.notion.soundefined)
    
    Number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years.
    
    Formulated by Gordon Moore in 1965 based on an observation
    
    This leads to predictions that we can expect the speed and capability of computers to increase every few years and we will pay less for them.
