    ## Base and Binary/Hex/Oct
    
    - Base
        - The number of different symbols required to represent any given number.
    - The larger the base, the more numbers are required.
        - Decimal (Base 10): 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
        - Binary (Base 2): 0, 1
        - Octal (Base 8): 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
        - Hexadecimal (Base 16): 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F
    - Examples
        
        - 10(10) = 1010(2) = 12(8) = A(16) // (base number)
        
          
        
        ## Conversion Table.

        ## Integer Representation
        
    - Five methods used for integer representation
        - unsigned
        - sign-and-magnitude
        - one’s compliment
        - two’s compliment
        - Biased representation
    - Almost all modern computers operate based on two’s compliment.
    
    ## Unsigned Integers
    
    - Unsigned integer: positive whole number or zero.
    - Store a while number as its binary representation
    - Value range determined by amount of bits
        - nibble = 15
        - byte = 255
    - n-bit binary can represent 2^n different numbers
        - 2^8 = 255 (256 including 0)
        - 2^16 = 65535 (+1 including 0)
        - 2^32 = 4,294,967,295
    
    ## Signed Integers
    
    A signed integer is a whole number with a sign. i.e could be + 0 and - integers.
    
    ## Sign and magnitude (S&M)
    
    - Use the left-most bit for sign (0 for + and 1 for -)
    - The rest of the bits are for the magnitude
    - Representation range for the value of a n-bit sign and magnitude number:
        - -2^n-1+1 … -0, +0 … 2^n-1-1
    - Half of integers are positive; half negative.
    - Example using 4 bits.
        - -2^3+1 … -0, +0 … 2^3-1
        - (You basically just lose the first bit as it’s used for sign) 0000 = -, 1000 = +
    
    ## S&M examples.
    
    22 = 0001 0110
    
    -100 = 1110 0100
    
    -264 = Error, cannot be represented in a Byte.
    
    ## Issues with S&M
    
    - n-bit can only represent $2^n -1$﻿ numbers.
    - 0 has two representations
    - Only used in some earlier computer systems since S&M based arithmetic computations are complex and difficult to implement in hardware.
    - Addition and Subtraction require attention to the sign bit.
        - If the same sign, it adds the magnitude but watches for overflow.
        - If the signs differ, subtract the smaller magnitude from the larger, and keep the sign of the larger.
    
    ## Two’s compliment.
    
    - The most common format used to represent signed integers in modern computers since hardware can do arithmetic calculation easily in 2’s compliment formats
    - Two’s compliment representation;
        - Positive numbers: Two’s compliment representation is binary number itself;
        - Negative numbers; Invert each bit of the corresponding positive numbers (i.e set 1 to 0 and 0 to 1) then add 1 to the result.
    - Value range determined by the number of bits:
        - n-bit: -2^n-1 … -1, +0 … 2^n-1 -1
    
    ## 2’s examples
    
    - for negative numbers:
        - find it normally
        - flip the bits
        - add 1
    
      
    
    36 = 0010 0100 (2’s compliment in 8bit with leading zeros)
    
    -82 = 0101 0010 (positive)  
    1010 1101 (inverted)  
    1010 1110, this is -82  
    
    ## Exercise
    
    Q: Find the S&M and 2’s compliment representations for -1
    
    **S&M:** 1000 0001 (8-bit), negative as first bit is 1.
    
    **2’s:** 0000 0001 = 1  
    1111 1110 = inversion  
    1111 1111 = -1 (inversion +1)

    ## Conversion between lengths
    
    How to change an integer with a smaller number of bits into the same integer with a larger number of bits
    
    - Unsigned: copy the original integer and add zeros at the start, e.g 0010 > 0000 0010
    - S&M: do the same as Unsigned just make sure there is room for sign bit, e.g 1010 0010 > 1000 0010 0010
    - 2’s: copy the original integer to he LSB, take the MSB of the original and copy it elsewhere (i dont get google)
    
    ## Sign extension examples
    
    - Unsigned representation
        - 18 = 00010010
        - 18 = 00000000 00010010
    - S&M representation
        - Positive numbers with leading zeros
            - 18 = 00010010
            - 18 = 00000000 00010010
        - Negative numbers with leading ones
            - -18 = 10010010
            - -18 = 10000000 00010010
    - 2’s represention
        - Positive number pack with leading zeros
            - 18 = 00010010
            - 18 = 00000000 00010010
        - Negative number pack with leading ones
            - -18 = 11101110
            - -18 = 11111111 11101110
    
    ![[Untitled 1 21.png|Untitled 1 21.png]]
    
    **Negative 2’s compliment numbers will always start with 1**
    
    ## Representing real numbers
    
    Q: How do we represent real numbers in computers.
    
    32.5 = 100000.1
    
    One quick solution: Fixed point representation
    
    Using a fixed number of bits for integer and fractional part
    
    A simple example of 16-bit fixed point for an unsigned integer:
    
    |   |   |   |
    |---|---|---|
    |8-bits integer|8-bits fraction|16-bit total|
    |0010 0000|1000 0000|0010 0000 1000 0000|
    
    **MAJOR ISSUE**: we’ve limited out range of integers by about half.
    
    ## Floating point
    
    - Analogues of scientific notation:
        - Floating point representations
    - Can represent very big and very small numbers
    - Binary number in scientific notation: significand x 2^exponent
        - e.g 100000.1(2 fixed-point) = 1.000001 x 2^5
    - A simple example of a 16-bit floating point
    
    |   |   |
    |---|---|
    |Exponent|Significand|
    |8 bit, 2’s compliment|8 bit, 2’s compliment|
    
    ## IEEE 754 Formats
    
    - Representation:
        
        - Sign, exponent, significand: (-1)^sign * significand * base^exponent
        - More bits for **significand** gives more accuracy
        - more bits for **exponent** increases range
        
        ![[Untitled 2 21.png|Untitled 2 21.png]]
        
    
    ## ==Floating point - example==

    - ==Get the sign/biased exponent/normalised significand:==
        - ==Positive so first bit = 0==
        - ==8-bit biased exponent: 127(this is based on the bits of the biased exponent)+5(exponent) = 132 ; 132 ; 10000100==

    ## Representing Images and Graphics
    
    - Color is our perception of the various frequencies of light that reach the retinas of out eyes
    - Color is often expressed as an RGB value
    - An example of an RGB value would be {255, 255, 0} or 0xFFFF00 in hex, this is additive as the number adds to it but it could be subtractive if we want it to be
    - The amount of data (bits) that is used to represent a color is called the color depth.
    - HiColor: A 15 or 16-bit color depth. five bits used for each number in an RGB value with an extra bit sometimes used to represent alpha
    - TrueColor: indicated a 24-bit color depth, Therefor each number in an RGB value is represented using 8 bits.
    
    ## Image data
    
    - Photographs, figures, icons, drawings, charts and graphs
    - Two approaches:
        - Bitmap or raster images of photos and paintings with continuous variation
        - Object or vector images composed of graphical objects like lines and curves defined geometrically.
    - Differences include
        - Image quality
        - Storage space required
        - Time to transmit
        - Ease of modification
    
    ## Bitmap Images
    
    - Digitizing an image is the act of representing is as a collection of individual dots called pixels
    - **Pixel** a small square with an associated coordinate location.
    - The number of pixels used to represent a picture is called the resolution
    
      
    
    - Each individual pixel (pix element) stored as a binary number
        
        - Monochrome: black or while, 1 bit per pixel
        - Greyscale: in different shades of grey, 1 byte per pixel
        - Color graphics: 16 colors, 256 colors, or 24-bit true color (16.7 million colours)
        
          
        
    
    ## Storing bitmap images
    
    - Frequently large files
        - Files size example: a raw RGB bitmap image has 600 rows or 800 pixels with 1 byte for each of the 3 colors, what is the rough file size  
            600x800x3 bytes = 1440KB ~1.5MB  
            
    - File size affected by
        - Resolution
        - Levels/Color depth
        - Data compression
    
    ## Bitmap image Formats
    
    - JPEG
        - Allows more than 16 million colours
        - Most important current standard for image compression using lossy compression algorithm
    - GIF
        - Indexed color limited to 8-bit (256 colour) only producing acceptable images
        - Animated images allowing displaying sequentially in fixed time sequences
        - Using lossless compression
    - PNG
        - Designed to replace GIF and JPEG for internet apps
        - Improved lossless compression
        - No animation support
    - TIFF
        - Used in high-quality image processing, particularly in publishing
        - Extensible
    - BMP
        - Device-independent format for Microsoft Windows environment
    
    ## Vector images
    
    - Composed of lines and shapes in various colours
    - Cannot represent photos or paintings
    - Examples of vector image formats: SVG, EPS, Postscript etc.
    - Popular vector graphics software: Adobe Flash, AutoCAD etc.
    
    ## Representing Video
    
    - Video: as a collection of still images
    - Frame rate: the number of still images shown per second
        - Most video cameras use a frame rate of 30fps
    - Require massive amount of data
        - Video camera producing 640x480px true colour image at 30fps = 640 x 480 x 30 x 3 = 27.65MB/s
        - 1 minute clip = 1.6GB.
    - Many formats mainly depending on the usage and device
        - MP4: most common file format which can play on many devices
        - Many others; MOV, WMV, AVI, SWF, FLV with various qualities and storage requirements
        - All use some data compression techniques
    
    ## Audio information representation
    
    - Sound is perceived when a series of air compressions vibrate a membrane in out ear which sends signals to the brain
    - To digitize the analogue sound signal, we periodically measure the voltage of he signal and record the appropriate numeric value. This process is called sampling
    - Sampling rate: Number of times per second sound is measured when recording
        - 1000 samples per second = 1KHz
        - Audio CD sampling rate = 44.1KHz
    - Height of each sample (amplitude) saved as:
        - 8-bit radio-quality recordings
        - 16-bit high-fidelity recordings
        - 2 x 16-bits for stereo
    
    ## Audio formats
    
    - Several popular formats: WAV, MP3, AU and AIFF
    - WAV: General purpose format for storing and reproducing small snippets of sound uncompressed.
    - MP3
        - Dominant formats for compressing audio
        - Discards sounds outside human hearing range
        - Analyzes the frequency spread and discards information that can’t be heard
        - Bit stream is compressed using a form of Huffman encoding
    - MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface): music notation systems that allow computer to communicate with music synthesizers.
    
    ## Data compression
    
    - Compression: recording data so that it required fewer bytes of storage
    - Compression ratio: the amount the file is shrunk
    - Lossless: inverse algorithm restores data back to original form
    - Lossy: trades off data degradation for file size and download speed.
        - Much higher compression ratios, normally 10 to 1
        - JPEG
    - MPEG-2 uses both forms for 100:1
