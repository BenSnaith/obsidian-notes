    **What is a function**
    
    A function can be seen as a mathematical construct that takes input and then supplies outputs
    
    say we input x and we get the output y
    
    $f(x)$﻿ this simply means a function applied to x, so you might see this same notation with the same input providing different outputs, the $f$﻿ simply shows that there is a function but does not specify what that is so the outputs are allowed to be different
    
    **Linear Function**
    
    A function that, when plotted onto a graph, will produce a straight line, notice the word line in line-ar.
    
    A linear function follows the format $f(x) = mx + b$﻿
    
    In this $x$﻿ is our input
    
    $m$﻿ is our coefficient by which $x$﻿ is multiplied
    
    $b $﻿ is a constant
    
    we can’t add any exponent so we cant square or root etc.
    
    $f(x) = 12x + 6$﻿ (Good)
    
    $f(x) = 15x^2 + 6$﻿ (Bad)
    
    $f(x) = 4 + 14x$﻿ (Good, but reordered)
    
    $f(x) = 2x - 1$﻿ (Good, just -)
    
    **Quadratic Function**
    
    $f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x + 4$﻿
    
    here we have a linear component $3x$﻿, and we have a constant $+ 4$﻿ these parts are optional, we can have either, neither or both, the $2x^2$﻿ is what makes this actually Quadratic when plotted to a graph you will see a U-shaped curve which will be flipped if dealing with $-x^2$﻿ which is also quadratic, for each value of $y$﻿there are two values for $x $﻿except at the very point of the graphs, this point is called the vertex and the value of $y$﻿ only has one value of $x$﻿
    
    **Exponential Function**
    
    In an exponential function, our independent variable $x$﻿ becomes our exponent.
    
    $f(x) = 2^x$﻿
    
    A exponential function can be quite steep so we will tabulate this first
    
    |x|y|
    |---|---|
    |-2|0.25|
    |-1|0.5|
    |0|1|
    |1|2|
    |2|4|
    |3|8|
    |4|16|
    |5|32|
    
    **Logarithmic Function**
    
    Where a exponential curve grows steeper when approaching higher numbers for $x$﻿ a logarithmic functional becomes much shallower.
    
    $f(x) = log _2x$﻿
    
    |x|y|
    |---|---|
    |1|0|
    |2|1|
    |3|1.58|
    |4|2|
    |5|2.32|
    |6|2.58|
    |7|2.81|
    |8|3|
    
    For these we ask, to what power do we need to raise 2 to reach the input value

    **Plotting relations**
    
    A relation between sets A and B = a subset of the Cartesian Product  
    A x B  
    
    Example 1:
    
    A = {1, 2, 3} B = {7, 8, 9}
    
    A x B {(1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9)}
    
    ![[Untitled 23.png|Untitled 23.png]]
    
    Example 2:
    
    A x A = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)}
    
    {(x, y) ∈ A x A | x divides y}
    
    a divides b if there is an integer such that ac = b.

    **Elementary Functions: What and Why in maths**
    
    Elementary functions = functions with an input, x ∈ A ⊆ R, defined using **plus, times, divide, exp, log, trigonometric functions**
    
    Can be used to model reality
    
    Examples:
    
    Distance and time during a trip
    
    Height of a ball and time thrown up
    
    Money earned and hours worked
    
      
    
    **Function - Definition**
    
    A function from a set A to a set B assigns to each element of A exactly one element of B

    **Linear Functions**
    
    - Graph is a straight line
    - $f(x) = mx + c$﻿
    - m: slope
    - c: intercept
    
      
    
    - Slope sign = function direction
    - m > 0 — function is increasing
    - m = 0 — function is constant
    - m < 0 — function is decreasing

I am smart.

Linear Equations 101.

f(x) = 2x - 3

The function f(x), takes x and find y, so 3x - 3, is y

**HOW TO FIND X INTERCEPT**

2x - 3 = 0

Always that with this and then solve for X

2x = 3

x = 1.5

  

**HOW TO FIND WHERE TWO LINEAR FUNCTIONS INTERCEPT**

2x - 3 and -x

2x - 3 = -x

Solve for X

3x - 3 = 0

3x = 3

x = 1

Then insert this into once of the function to find why

-x = -1

y = -1
